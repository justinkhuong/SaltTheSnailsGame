Hello! Welcome to my game project. It is called Salt The Snails!

This was made during the Fall Quarter of 2019. The team members consisted of Justin Khuong, Randolf, Rawlin, and Jared.
It was all our first time making this game, so it is rough around the edges since we were all learning Unity and C#.

This is my own individual repository to this game because there were still some small changes I wanted to add in after 
everyone else was done working on the game.



To move use WASD
To shoot an arrow, aim with mouse and press left click
Pressing Q can toggle bomb arrows on allowing you to blow up certain blocks

Thank you for trying out my game!
